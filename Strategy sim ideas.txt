variables

Compound
degredation

fuel weight / reduced deg under these conditions

weather predictions
heavy rain
light rain
damp

secondary driver / comparative advantage

First determine optimum strategy, based off medium deg and pace


could make it since overtaking has been so hard this year, make possibility of overtakes extremely low, 
higher in first laps tho
overtaking possibility increases with difference in lap times, or would be lap times.
lap time gets capped if your 1 secnd behind person in front and you don't overtake
proability of overtake increases with DRS

so pit stops used to make overtakes.
pit stops take an average of 23 seconds add variance

call tire degredation linear
tyres like medium and hard get faster then slowly degreade

make assumptions every team has car as fast as each other ( maybe add in teams have slightly differeing lap time) 105% rule

teams are on same strategy ( i.e. in same window) 

cars at front have less deg due to dirty air
can calcualate dirty air due to timinings.
less than 1 second you have DRS cancels dirty air ( maybe not deg tho) ignore first 2 laps doesn't cause a diff
dirty air from 0-1.5 seconds heavy
2-3 seconds light - due to drivers saying they felt dirty air 4 seconds back

Add seconds for cars further back in starting grid
